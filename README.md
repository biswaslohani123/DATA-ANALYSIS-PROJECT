1. IPL CAPSTONE PROJECT

This is my first data analysis project where I explore the IPL 2022 season dataset. The goal is to analyze match statistics, team performances, player contributions, and various factors that influenced the outcomes of 74 matches.

I performed this analysis using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, applying basic data manipulation and visualization techniques to uncover insights from the data.
