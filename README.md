IPL 2022 Data Analysis – Capstone Project

This is my first data analysis project, where I explored the IPL 2022 season dataset. The goal is to analyze match statistics, team performances, player contributions, and factors that influenced the outcomes of 74 matches.

The analysis was performed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, applying basic data manipulation and visualization techniques to uncover insights from the data.

📊 Analysis Performed
1. Team Performance

Counted total matches won by each team.

Visualized results using bar charts.

Gujarat Titans emerged as the most successful team with 12 wins.

2. Toss Analysis

Analyzed toss decisions (Bat vs Field).

Examined the relationship between toss winner and match winner.

48.65% of toss winners went on to win the match.

3. Win Types

Compared wins by Runs vs Wickets.
