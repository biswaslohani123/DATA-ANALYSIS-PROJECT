IPL 2022 Data Analysis – Capstone Project

This is my first data analysis project, where I explored the IPL 2022 season dataset. The goal is to analyze match statistics, team performances, player contributions, and factors that influenced the outcomes of 74 matches.

The analysis was performed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, applying basic data manipulation and visualization techniques to uncover insights from the data.
